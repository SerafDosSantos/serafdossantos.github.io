I started translating the magnificent book _Mastering Bitcoin, 2nd Open Edition_ by Andreas M. Antonopoulos at the end of February 2022. The task is relatively simple as most of the tasks are automated through the computer-assisted translation platform--transifex.com (via Google Translate API I think).

The evolving project can be followed at [bitcoin.maitriser.ca](https://bitcoin.maitriser.ca).

I read the book last year through O'Reilly Online and understood the whole thing (of course!), so when I saw the book wasn't translated in French (fr_CA), I jumped right in.

The first thing I did was to have a look at some other French locale versions that were in the process of being translated.

French (fr_FR) wasn't started, and French (fr)--as a more generalistic French--was already half done, but to my mind, the text blocks I had read from it were not accessible to my locale, sounding too European. So a request for the French (fr_CA) translation had been answered but poorly started.

My locale is fr_CA, but I'm not an ace in French writing. French is more complicated than English--my second language--and I'm not at my best writing French vs writing English which I find easier (due to some professional habitude as I've read mostly in English the last 25 years).

If it weren't for the help of the translation API, I wouldn't have started this project, but let's face it--the translator profession is counting its last days. Let's say Transifex uses the Google Translate API. The sensible AI behind the whole service is quite capable to giveback. With at least 95% accuracy (from my experience through the project with the translation of plain English text to French (fr_CA)) accurately, the sentences are well translated most of the time.

The only downside from the whole Transifex experience was their inability to apply Glossary terms automatically to the translated text, as the Glossary is a local platform implementation on which the locale terms are suggested instead of applied directly on the API translated text. It would have sped the whole thing a bit...
