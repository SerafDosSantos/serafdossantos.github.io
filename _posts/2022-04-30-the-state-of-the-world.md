So this is it. I've culminated to understand some parts of time in our world. It ain't anything related to physics or advanced mathematical equations. It is through life and experience via human history and astrological studies.

Now, we have constellations with names. Called out at through times and again.

It is a simple deduction through information now know (commonly between cultivated?!?), that:

1. Agriculture began about 14 000 years ago,
2. The oldest known written document is now about 8 000 years old
3. A particular man known as the son of God was born around 2 000 years ago
4. The Earth has still a potential liveable state for another 10 000 years

What is missing? The return of the Matriarcal Era in about 4 500 years from now (as per the image).

The image above presents the state of our time in our Christ Era (Pisces) in this Holy year of 2022... If I can so speakely say in an enthousiasmic christian tone.
